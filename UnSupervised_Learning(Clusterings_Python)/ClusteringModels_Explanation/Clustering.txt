Agglomerative,data points are clustered using a bottom-up approach starting with individual data points.



In Divisive, top-down approach is followed where all the data points are treated as one big cluster and the clustering process 
involves dividing the one big cluster into several small clusters.


We use 'ward' as the method since it minimizes then variants of distances between the clusters.(Ward method is actually a method that tries to minimize the variance within each cluster)


The linkage method takes the dataset and the method to minimize distances as parameters. 

A dendrogram is a type of tree diagram showing hierarchical clustering — relationships between similar sets of data




Difference between K Means and Hierarchical clustering

    1. Hierarchical clustering can’t handle big data well but K Means clustering can. This is because the time complexity of K Means is linear i.e. O(n) 
       while that of hierarchical clustering is quadratic i.e. O(n2).
    2. In K Means clustering, since we start with random choice of clusters, the results produced by running the algorithm multiple times might differ.
       While results are reproducible in Hierarchical clustering.
    3. K Means is found to work well when the shape of the clusters is hyper spherical (like circle in 2D, sphere in 3D).
    4. K Means clustering requires prior knowledge of K i.e. no. of clusters you want to divide your data into.
       But, you can stop at whatever number of clusters you find appropriate in hierarchical clustering by interpreting the dendrogram
